                Music Hall is an indie folk band from Vancouver Island, Canada, comprised of multi-instrumentalists, Arlen Thompson (<a href="https://www.subpop.com/artists/wolf_parade">Wolf Parade</a>) and Andrew Halliwell (<a href="https://alifeinbinary.com/">A Life in Binary</a>), and married singer/songwriters, Tasha Cyr and Erik Virtanen.
                Their sophomore album “Bird Screaming”, a follow-up to the 2022 debut , was recorded by Andrew Halliwell and mixed by Arlen Thompson in the island towns of Lantzville and Nanaimo, British Columbia.
                The album was initiated by Canada Council for the Arts when Erik Virtanen was to write 10 songs inspired by life on the west coast after being away for many years. It led to honest musings on time slipping away, depression and anxiety, seeking a sense of place, and our connections with nature.
                Erik brought acoustic demos of the songs to the band where they were fully developed and arranged in studio. Music Hall’s resulting 10-track album, “Bird Screaming”, showcases four distinct creators blending acoustic folk and dreamy harmonies with elements of indie rock.
